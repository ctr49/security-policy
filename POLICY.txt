ORGNAME Security and Vulnerability Reporting Policy

1. Services Covered by this Policy

This policy covers all services directly operated by ORGNAME. Services
operated can be identified by the following means:
- The website has a .well-known/security.txt that links to this policy.
- The reverse DNS of an IP address resolves to one of the following
  domains: example.com

2. Classification of Vulnerabilities

We consider vulnerabilities as relevant when they meet one or more of
the following conditions:
- The vulnerability can be used to directly access non-public
  information that either reveals further security relevant problems or
  contains user data.
- The vulnerability can be used to disrupt the orderly operation of a
  service.
- The vulnerability can be used to manipulate data within the service.
- XSS, CSRF, RCE, authentication/authorization bypass, SQL inections,
  etc are considered relevant.

We consider reports of vulnerabilities not as relevant when they contain
the following information:
- A service is missing HTTP security headers or comparable "add-on security"
  features.
- Publicly accessible version strings of used software.
- Security vulnerablities that can only be used within the scope of the
  used account.

3. Reporting Vulnerabilities

Report vulnerabilities via e-mail to security@example.com. For
encryption the PGP key https://example.com/pubkey.asc can be used.

Please make sure that you include the following information:
- Which service is affected
- How can the bug be used/exploited
- Explanation of the risk

4. Bug Bounties / Vulnerability Rewards

The amount of reward payed depends on the severity of the found
vulnerability. We usually do not pay rewards if vulnerabilities can be
found in mass scans with of-the-shelf software.

5. Acknowledgement

We list recognized reports of vulnerablities online if the reporting
security researcher agrees. The name, contact e-mail address, and type of
vulnerability can be included in the list.
